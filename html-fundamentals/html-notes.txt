# HTML - HyperText Markup Language

- It is a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a web page.
- It is not a programming language.
- HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
  paragraphs,links,headings,images,video,etc.
- Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.



For bold we can use either <b> or <strong> , but is recommended to use the <strong> tag because the <b> tag was used in older HTML and in HTML 5 it is recommended to use the <strong> element. 

For italics , <i> is older , <em> is recommended instead of this.


--Semantic HTML--

Introduced in HTML 5.

Not all html elements are semantic but some are semantic elements and they do have some meaning associated with it
<strong> element is a semantic html element and it means it is a very important element.
<em> for emphasis
<nav> represents that ,  it is for navigation , same for article,footer and header etc.
<p> means paragraph

Semantic HTML is used to give the elements , a meaning.

SEO optimisation and helps people who depends on screen readers.
