# HTML - HyperText Markup Language

- It is a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a web page.
- It is not a programming language.
- HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
  paragraphs,links,headings,images,video,etc.
- Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.



For bold we can use either <b> or <strong> , but is recommended to use the <strong> tag because the <b> tag was used in older HTML and in HTML 5 it is recommended to use the <strong> element. 

For italics , <i> is older , <em> is recommended instead of this.
